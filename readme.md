## 📦 Installing

1. `cd path/to/your/project`
2. Run `npm i yiff`

This Module relies on [axios](https://npmjs.org/package/axios "A link to the axios package on npm") and [chalk](https://npmjs.org/package/chalk "A link to the chalk package on npm"), so if it doesn't work try to install them using `npm i axios && npm i chalk`

## ❓ FAQ

> **Q:** Will you add other APIs as well?\
> **A:** Depends on if they're either free or I get a all-access token
